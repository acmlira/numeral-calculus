# Like a boilerplate
You may have noticed that my files have specific characteristics, and they are:
 - **Python**
 - My *mnemonics, labels* and *functions* are written in **English**
 - But, the *comments*, they are written in **Brazilian Portuguese**
 - All codes have explanations about the background theory in **Jupyter notebooks**

# Seeya!
